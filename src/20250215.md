### 1. gen10(intel) zkfd
Install system, pass `nomodeset` to grub items.   

After installation, i915 driver won't take effects.  
### 2. xfs issue
zkfd's xfsprogs is too old to mount `xfs on mapper`, so I mount the usb disk on archlinux(could mount properly on archlinux first) and `xfs_repair /dev/mapper/vol` , soonly it won't be mounted. Error messages:     

```
[218555.149809] Buffer I/O error on dev dm-0, logical block 121679856, async page read
[218555.150428] EXT4-fs (dm-0): unable to read superblock
```

Beware of this `xfs_repair` command.
